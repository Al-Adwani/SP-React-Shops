#### Shop Detail

Let's fix the shop detail page! In this detail page, the shop's list of products should be displayed.

1. In `ShopDetail`, render the `ProductList` component and pass it the products as a prop.

#### Product Create

At the moment, when we create a product, the form doesn't ask for the shop ID.

1. Create a new method that creates a new product.
2. Keep in mind that you need to pass the ID to the create method.
